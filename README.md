# RRR
RRR means randomly replace recovery scheme, which is effective for the data reconstruction of any XOR-based erasure code. In the current version, we mainly implement three algorithms for experiments: Zpacr,the hill-climbing algorithm; RRR, the simulated annealing algorithm; enumeration, the enumeration algorithm. This platform is based on the Jerasure-1.2 library, which contains a variety of erasure codes: Reed_Sol_Van, Cauchy_Orig, Cauchy_Good, Liberation, Blaum_Roth, Liber8tion.
